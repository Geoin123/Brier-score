Brier-score
======================
The Brier score is a proper score function that measures the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. 
It is applicable to tasks in which predictions must assign probabilities to a set of mutually exclusive discrete outcomes.
The set of possible outcomes can be either binary or categorical in nature, and the probabilities assigned to this set of outcomes 
must sum to one (where each individual probability is in the range of 0 to 1). 

The Brier score can range from 0, if odds guessed the outcome directly by stating there is 100% chance of only one outcome to be correct, to 2, if odds implied that one outcome is certain and that did not occur.

Also known as Quadratic Loss (Hvattum & Arntzen, 2010), the Brier Score measures the average
squared deviation between predicted probabilities for a set of their events and their outcomes. For an
individual match the score is (Brier, 1950)
