Brier-score
======================
The Brier score is a proper score function that measures the accuracy of probabilistic predictions. 
It is applicable to tasks in which predictions must assign probabilities to a set of mutually exclusive discrete outcomes.
The set of possible outcomes can be either binary or categorical in nature, and the probabilities assigned to this set of outcomes 
must sum to one (where each individual probability is in the range of 0 to 1). 

The Brier score can range from 0, if odds guessed the outcome directly by stating there is 100% chance of only one outcome to be correct, to 2, if odds implied that one outcome is certain and that did not occur.

Football is unpredictable. That unpredictability gives the sport its appeal inspires the fans and also gives betting punters a headache week in, week out. Using a verification measure like the Brier Score gives betters a more systematic point of view as to what is happening in the league right now

Brier Score = (Actual Result - Probability Assigned to Actual Result)^2

Also known as Quadratic Loss (Hvattum & Arntzen, 2010), the Brier Score measures the average
squared deviation between predicted probabilities for a set of their events and their outcomes. For an
individual match the score is  (Brier, 1950)

Disadvantages of the Brier score

Rare diseases. It is difficult to see differences in populations with
small prevalence

Intuition. It does not penalise very small forecasted probabilities
when they should be giving larger probabilities to the same extent
that we penalise such forecasts with our intuition. Intuition
apparently uses fractional or logarithmic rather than differences in
probability. 

For binary and continuous and right censored outcome the Brier score can be used  to ﬁnd predictive or diagnostic markers ◮ to assess the predictive performance of a traditional statistical model ◮ to assess an algorithmic (black box) model ◮ to detect overﬁtting ◮ to compare simple to complex models ◮ for focussed and automated model selectio
